Attempt to mess with Class and inheritance, this is a very basic random character generator for a role playing game, probably targeted on OSRIC (aka wink-wink AD&D 1st ed: http://www.knights-n-knaves.com/osric/)

Things to do:

Make a Class character with attributes (Strength, Endurance, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma), an array with alignments, an array with races and an array with classes.  Maybe top it off with a string for description.

After the class is solid and you can generate new characters by using a method, work out some way to randomly generate each stat.  And for extra sugar, have it all write out to a text file!  Badass!
